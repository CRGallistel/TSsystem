function TSaddpositioncol(StartPosition)
% Creates a TSDataP field that contains same data as TSData field, but
% with 3rd col giving position of wheel at each even. One can make this the
% active data field when analyzing wheel data. I will modify TSparse so
% that has 'position' as a privileged word (as well as 'time' etc)
%
% Syntax:  TSaddpositioncol(StartPosition)
%
% StartPosition is the position of the wheel when session begins, e.g.
% 85000
