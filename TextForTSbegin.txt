Before proceeding, you should know (*=obligatory):  1)* The ID number that uniquely identifies this experiment in your laboratory  2)* The parent directory for this experiment. (In the Gallistel lab, this is always      the Dropbox.)  3)* The ID numbers of the subjects. These numbers should uniquely identify a subject       (like a social security number); no other subject in any other experiment        in this lab, past or present, should have the same ID number)  4)* The species of your subjects  5)* Their strain (e.g., C57BL/6j)  6)* Their sex  7) Their weights on arrival from the supplier  8) The dates of their arrival  9)* Their source (e.g, Harlan)  10)* The MedPC program(s) that will run the first session  11)* The location of a folder containing the custom data-analyzing functions that will        analyze the data from this (these) protocol(s)  12)* The unit (in seconds) for the time stamps in the raw data files (default is .02)  13)* The unit of time (in seconds) for the session times displayed in the Experiment       structure (default is 1)  14)* The load function that will be called by TSloadsessions when it loads your raw        data files into the Experiment structure (default is TSloadMEDPC, which        assumes that your raw data files have the default form)  15)* The prefix character (first character) in the names of your raw data files.        (Default is !) The prefix character distinguishes raw data files from other files.  16)* The extension of your raw data files. (Default is to ignore extension.) Raw data       files may be distinguished by their extension rather than by a prefix character.If you are unclear about any of the above, you may want to consult p. ?? in the Manual   before continuing.
